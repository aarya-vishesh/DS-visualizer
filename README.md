# DS-visualizer

**Pathfinding Visualizer (In Progress)** : 
This is a Pathfinding Visualizer project that showcases the inner workings of two popular pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm.


**Features:**  

**Interactive Grid:** Allows users to set the source, destination, and obstacles by clicking on the grid.

**Real-Time Visualization:** Watch BFS and Dijkstra algorithms work step-by-step to find the shortest path.

**Performance Tracking:** View the time taken for each algorithm to complete the pathfinding process.


**Technologies Used:**

**JavaScript:** For implementing the pathfinding algorithms and user interactions.

**HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the visualizer.

**BFS (Breadth-First Search) and Dijkstra:** Pathfinding algorithms for grid-based shortest path calculations.
