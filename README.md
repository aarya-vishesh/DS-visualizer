# DS-visualizer

Pathfinding Visualizer (In Progress)
This is a Pathfinding Visualizer project that showcases the inner workings of two popular pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm. Inspired by a YouTuber’s work, I created a lighter version of the visualizer using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Features
Interactive Grid: Allows users to set the source, destination, and obstacles by clicking on the grid.
Real-Time Visualization: Watch BFS and Dijkstra algorithms work step-by-step to find the shortest path.
Performance Tracking: View the time taken for each algorithm to complete the pathfinding process.
Smooth User Experience: No scrollbars, and the grid fits neatly in the browser window.
Technologies Used
JavaScript: For implementing the pathfinding algorithms and user interactions.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the visualizer.
BFS (Breadth-First Search) and Dijkstra: Pathfinding algorithms for grid-based shortest path calculations.
How to Use
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-visualizer.git

Open the index.html file in your browser.
Interact with the grid:
Click to set the source (blue) and destination (red).
Click to toggle blocked cells (gray).
Press Visualize BFS or Visualize Dijkstra to see the algorithms in action.
View the time taken for each algorithm below the grid.
Installation
Ensure you have a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
Open the project folder and double-click on index.html to launch the visualizer.
Future Enhancements
Adding more pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*).
Optimizing the visualizer for performance with larger grids.
Adding support for customizable grid sizes.
